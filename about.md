{% include JB/setup %}

I am self-taught programmer with a computational/theoretical chemistry background.
My language of choice is Python, but I did most of my graduate work in Fortran.
I also use C++, Perl, Tcl, Bash & Csh.  I enjoy scripting, particularly text parsing
and automation.  I also enjoy writing numerical and scientific code.
